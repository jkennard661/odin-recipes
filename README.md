The Odin Project- Foundations: Recipe Project

Project Description:

Build a website with recipes of you're favorite foods.  
The recipe webpages should should contain an image of the food, a description of the food, an ingredients list, and a step-by-step guide on how to make the food.
The recipe webpages should also have a way to navigate to the other webpages on your website (relative links).
The homepage should have a title, an image or two, and a way to navigate to the recipe webpages. 

Skills I Demonstrated By Completing the Project:

-Ability to create a GitHub repository
-Ability to git clone
-Ability to commit changes to Git during the project
-Ability to navigate the file system
-Ability to navigate the command line
-Ability to add images to a webpage
-Ability to add links to a webpage
-Ability to add text to a webpage
-Ability to manipulate text on a webpage (bold and italicized)
-Ability to create ordered and un-ordered lists on a webpage
-Ability to problem-solve

CSS Foundations:

The skills I demonstrated by adding CSS to this website include:

-The ability to create a css file and link it to different webpages
-The ability to style text using font-size, font-family, color, and text-align
-The ability to style images and link the styling properties to the correct webpage
-The ability to use style selctors: type selector, grouping selector, chaining selector, descendant combinator
-The ability to add the correct style selectos to html elements
-The ability to manipulate the casscading style of css to correctly style my pages

Looking back on this project I did not use background color or id selectors. Also my understanding of how grouping selectors and descendant combinators is not 100%.
My strong suit is with class selectors and in using chain selectors. I was able to trouble-shoot pretty well, and the reason I was able to do this was (1) I looked back 
on previous projects to fill in my knowledge gap and (2) I was able to stay calm and not get frustrated when my code did not work.
