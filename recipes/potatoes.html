                <li>On a cutting board, peel the potatoes. Place the potatoes in a large bowl of cold water after peeling to avoid discoloration.</li>
                <li>Cut the potatoes into 1-inch (2 cm) cubes.</li>
                <li>Add the potatoes to a large pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 12 minutes.</li>
                <li>In a small saucepan, bring the milk, heavy cream, and garlic to a simmer over low heat.</li>
                <li>Remove the pot from the heat and strain the cream through a fine mesh sieve.</li>
                <li>Drain the potatoes in a colander and transfer back to the pot.</li>
                <li>Mash the potatoes with a potato masher, potato ricer, or by pushing through a fine mesh sieve with a spatula.</li>
                <li>Add the cubed cold butter and salt. Stir to combine.</li>
                <li>Gradually add the cream mixture to the potatoes, little by little, until fully incorporated.</li>
                <li>Top with freshly ground black pepper and sprinkle with chives and serve.</li>
                <li class="cutting">Enjoy!</li>
