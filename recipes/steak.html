        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>6 oz filet mignon</li>
                <li>coarse salt</li>
                <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon grapeseed oil, or other high-heat, neutral oil of choice</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
                <li>1 clove garlic</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>On a cutting board, pat the filet mignon dry with paper towels and let sit at room temperature for 20-30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 450˚F (230˚C).</li>
                <li>Generously season all sides of the filet mignon with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Heat a medium, oven-safe stainless steel or cast iron skillet over high heat for 5 minutes. Add the grapeseed oil.</li>
                <li>Once the oil beings to smoke, add the filet mignon to the pan. Cook without moving for 2-3 minutes, until a crust has formed.</li>
                <li>Use tongs to flip the steak over, then add the butter, rosemary, and garlic to the pan.</li>
                <li>Tilt the pan and spoon the butter continuously over the steak for 2-3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Transfer the pan to the oven for 7 minutes for a medium rare steak.</li>
                <li>Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
